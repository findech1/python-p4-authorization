# Authorizing Requests Notes

## Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between _authentication_ and _authorization_.
- Restrict access to routes to authorized users only.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: a subfield of software engineering that
  focuses on users, their attributes, their login information, and the resources
  that they are allowed to access.
- **Authentication**: proving one's identity to an application in order to
  access protected information; logging in.
- **Authorization**: allowing or disallowing access to resources based on a
  user's attributes.
- **Session**: the time between a user logging in and logging out of a web
  application.
- **Cookie**: data from a web application that is stored by the browser. The
  application can retrieve this data during subsequent sessions.

## Introduction

So far, we've been talking about how to **authenticate** users, i.e., how to
confirm that a user is who they say they are. We've been using their username as
our means of authentication; in the future, we'll also add a password to our
authentication process.

In addition to **authentication**, most applications also need to implement
**authorization**: giving certain users permission to access specific resources.
For example, we might want **all** users to be able to browse blog posts, but
only **authenticated** users to have access to premium features, like creating
their own blog posts. In this lesson, we'll learn how we can use the session
object to authenticate users' requests, and give them explicit permission to
access certain routes in our application.

## First Pass: Manual Checks

Let's say we have a `Document` resource. Its `get()` method looks like this:

```py
class Document(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
        document = Document.query.filter(Document.id == id).first()
        return document.to_dict()

```

Now let's add a new requirement: documents should only be shown to users when
they're logged in. From a technical perspective, what does it actually mean for
a user to _log in_? When a user logs in, all we are doing is using cookies to
add their `user_id` to the `session` object.

The first thing you might do is to add a **guard clause** as the first line of
`Document.get()`:

```py
class Document(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
        
        if not session['user_id']:
            return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

        document = Document.query.filter(Document.id == id).first()
        return document.to_dict()

```

Unless the session includes `user_id`, we return an error. In this case, if a
user isn't logged in, we return `401 Unauthorized`.

***

## Refactor

This code works fine, so you use it in a few places. Now your
`Document` resource looks like this:

```py
class Document(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
        
        if not session['user_id']:
            return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

        document = Document.query.filter(Document.id == id).first()
        return document.to_dict()

    def patch(self, id):

        if not session['user_id']:
            return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

        # patch code

    def delete(self, id):

        if not session['user_id']:
            return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

        # delete code
```

That doesn't look so DRY. Wouldn't it be great if there were a way to ask Flask
to run some code **before** any **action**?

Fortunately, Flask gives us a solution: [`before_request`][before]. We can
refactor our code like so:

```py
@app.before_request
def check_if_logged_in():
    if not session['user_id']:
        return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

class Document(Resource):
    def get(self, id):

        document = Document.query.filter(Document.id == id).first()
        return document.to_dict()

    def patch(self, id):

        # patch code

    def delete(self, id):

        # delete code
```

We've moved our guard clause into its own function and that's it! Request hooks
in Flask act upon objects that manipulate the `request` context _automatically_.
This means that if an object is configured to do anything to a request, our
`before_request` hook will be executed first.

***

## Skipping Filters for Certain Endpoints

What if we wanted to let anyone see a list of documents, but keep the
`before_request` hook for the `Document` methods? We could do this:

```py
@app.before_request
def check_if_logged_in():
    if not session['user_id'] \
        and request.endpoint != 'document_list' :
        return {'error': 'Unauthorized'}, 401

class Document(Resource):
    def get(self, id):

        document = Document.query.filter(Document.id == id).first()
        return document.to_dict()

    def patch(self, id):

        # patch code

    def delete(self, id):

        # delete code

class DocumentList(Resource):
    def get(self):
        
        documents = Document.query.all()
        return [document.to_dict() for document in documents]

api.add_resource(Document, '/documents/<int:id>', endpoint='document')
api.add_resource(DocumentList, '/documents', endpoint='document_list')

```

This added if/else logic tells Flask to ignore certain resources, defined by a
string `endpoint`. This is set automatically to the lowercase version of the
class or function name, but it's often best to be explicit and name it when we
add our resources.

***

## Conclusion

To **authorize** a user for specific actions, we can take advantage of the fact
that all logged in users in our application will have a `user_id` saved in the
session object. We can use a `before_request` hook to run some code that will
check the `user_id` in the session and only authorize users to run those
actions if they are logged in.

## Check For Understanding

Before you move on, make sure you can answer the following questions:

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?</em>
  </summary>

  <p>Authentication is the process of proving you are who you are- i.e., logging
     in.</p>
  <p>Authorization is the process of deciding who gets access to what. This
     usually includes a check to see if a user is logged in, but it can also
     involve unique privileges that they have within the app, like which
     profiles you can view in full on Instagram.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>2. Which Flask decorator can we use to add an authorization step
        before each of the actions in our app?</em>
  </summary>

  <p>The <code>before_request</code> hook.</p>
  <p>Remember that conditional statements in your <code>before_request</code>
     block can whitelist certain views.</p>
